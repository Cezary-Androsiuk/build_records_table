# build_records_table
Building two dimensional (good looking) table to represent data, given in 2d matrix builded from vectors containing std::strings.
Will be used to print sqlite records.
Might be possible an update in the future cause large data won't fit in terminal without wordwrap.

```
git clone https://github.com/Cezary-Androsiuk/build_records_table
cd build_records_table
g++ main.cpp -o main && ./main
```
